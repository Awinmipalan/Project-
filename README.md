# My personal Project
## My Projects
### project1
#### Inter galactic travel

##### data source
kaggle

#### Aim
To analyze This data and create a model that predict the loyalty of the individual involve in this space travel.

##### road map
mine data, extract the data, load the data, transform the data, save the data, create model on regression a statistical model,significance test and visualization.

##### file
notebook(repo2),
py file(repo2).

could not upload raw data file cause file is above 25mb.

#### Tool
tableau public, python, Mysql, gretl, Evan Miller.org and power bi

#### process
first mine for insight in tableau public.
use python to  extract the csv file clean and transform the file, by creating dummy and changing data time format. 
The interesting part is saving these file in MySql straight from python using the pymysql syntax.
The save file can be exported using Csv format.
proceed to gretl for modelling.
proceed to envanmiller.org for statistical significance test.
visualizing using power bi both  the prediction and significant data.

#### limitation.
could not use iteration for my transfer of data to mysql because of data size.

### project2
### absenteeism

##### data source
360 data school 

#### Aim
To analyze This data and create a model that predict the probability of been absent and minimize the level of absenteeism to increase efficiency 

##### road map
extract the data, load the data, transform the data, save the data, create model on regression a statistical model,model testing using CAP, significance test and visualization.

##### file
absenteeism file contains the raw file
model file
notebook file
py file
csv file exported from mysql.
excel CAP template file

#### Tool
python, Mysql, gretl, Evan Miller.org,power bi and excel 

#### process
use python to  extract the csv file clean and transform the file, by creating dummy and changing data time format. 
saving this file in MySql straight from python using the pymysql syntax.
The save file can be exported using Csv format.
proceed to gretl for modelling, after modelling i use cummulative accuracy profile (CAP) to access my model and i was not satisfied with over 65percent prediction accuracy so i move to python to run my regression analysis.
proceed to envanmiller.org for statistical significance test.
did create new model using python that can calculate absenteeism with 80 percent accuracy.
visualizing using power bi both  the prediction and significant data.

#### limitation.
iteration takes time.
gretl model was bias due to the data having over 90 percent of 1

##### visualization link

#### achievement gotten from these two model are 
1.  efficiency
2.  budget reduction
3.  increase in productivity
4.  maintaining a healthy working environment my assigning the right task that are achievable
