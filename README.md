# My personal Project
## My Projects
### project1
#### Inter galactic travel

##### data source
keggle

#### Aim
To analyze This data and create a model that predict the loyalty of the individual involve in this space travel.

##### road map
mine data, extract the data, load the data, transform the data, save the data, create model on regression a statistical model,significance test and visualization.

#### Tool
tableau public, python, Mysql, gretl, Evan Miller.org and power bi

#### process
first mine for insight in tableau public.
use python to  extract the csv file clean and transform the file, by creating dummy and changing data time format. 
The interesting part is saving these file in MySql straight from python using the pymysql syntax.
The save file can be exported using Csv format.
proceed to gretl for modelling.
proceed to envanmiller.org for statistical significance test.
visualizing using power bi both  the prediction and significant data.

#### limitation.
could not use iteration for my transfer of data to mysql because of data size.

### project2
### absenteeism

##### data source
360 data school 

#### Aim
To analyze This data and create a model that predict the probability of been absent and minimize the level of absenteeism to increase efficiency
